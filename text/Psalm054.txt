1. Save me, O | God, · by your | name; ||
    vindi|cate me | by your | might.
2. Hear my | prayer, · O | God; ||
    listen | to the | words · of my | mouth.

3. Arrogant foes are a|ttacking | me; ||
    ruthless people are trying to kill me - *
    people wi|thout re|gard for | God.

4. Surely | God · is my | help; ||
    the Lord is the | one who | sustains | me.

5. Let evil recoil on | them who | slander me; ||
    - | in your | faithfulness · de|stroy them.

6. I will sacrifice a freewill | offering · to | you; ||
    I will praise your name, | LORD, for | it is | good.
7. You have delivered me from | all my | troubles, ||
    and my eyes have looked in | triumph | on my | foes.
