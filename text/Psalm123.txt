1. I lift up my | eyes to | you, ||
    to you who | sit enthr|oned in | heaven.
2. As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master, *
    as the eyes of a female slave look to the | hand · of her | mistress, ||
so our eyes look to the Lord our God, *
    | till he | shows us · his | mercy.

3. Have mercy on us, Lord, have | mercy | on us, ||
    for we have en|dured no | end · of con|tempt.
4. We have endured no end
    of ridicule | from the | arrogant, ||
    of con|tempt | from the | proud.
