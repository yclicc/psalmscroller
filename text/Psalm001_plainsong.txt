Bles*sed* is the one who does not walk in step **with** the **wick**ed *
or stand in the way that sinners take
    or sit in the compa**ny** of *mock*ers,
2 but whose delight is in the **law** of **the** Lord, *
    and who meditates on his **law** day *and* night.
3 That person is like a tree planted by **streams** of **wa**ter, *
    which yields its **fruit** in *sea*son
and whose leaf **does** not **with**er *
    Whaever **they** do *pros*pers.

4 Not **so** the **wick**ed! *
    They are like chaff that the **wind** blows *a*way.
5 Therefore the wicked will not **stand** in the **judg**ment, *
    nor sinners in the assembly **of** the *right*eous.

6 For the Lord watches over the way **of** the **right**eous, *
    but the way of the wicked leads **to** dest*ruc*tion.
