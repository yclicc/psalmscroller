1. Out of the depths I | cry · to you, | Lord; ||
2.   - | Lord, | hear my | voice.
Let your | ears · be at|tentive ||
    to | my | cry for | mercy.

3. If you, Lord, | kept a · record of | sins, ||
    Lord, | who | could | stand?
4. But with you there | is for|giveness, ||
    so that we can, with | rever·ence, | serve | you.

5. I wait for the Lord, my | whole · being | waits, ||
    and in his | word I | put my | hope.
6. I wait for the Lord *
    more than watchmen | wait · for the | morning, ||
    more than | watchmen | wait · for the | morning.
