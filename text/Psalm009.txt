1. I will give thanks to you, LORD, with | all my | heart; ||
    I will tell of | all your | wonder·ful | deeds.
2. I will be glad and re|joice in | you; ||
    I will sing the | praises · of your | name, · O | Most High.

3. My ene|mies turn | back; ||
    they stumble and | perish | before | you.
4. For you have upheld my | right · and my | cause, ||
    sitting en|throned · as the | righteous | judge.
5. You have rebuked the nations and | destroyed · the | wicked; ||
    you have blotted out their | name for | ever and | ever.
6. Endless ruin has overtaken my enemies, *
    you have up|rooted their | cities; ||
    even the | memory · of | them has | perished.

7. The LORD | reigns for | ever; ||
    he has e|stablished · his | throne for | judgement.
8. He rules the | world in | righteousness ||
    and | judges · the | peoples · with | equity.
9. The LORD is a refuge | for the · opp|ressed, ||
    a | stronghold · in | times of | trouble.
10. Those who know your name | trust in | you, ||
    for you, LORD, have never for|saken those | who seek | you.

11. Sing the praises of the LORD, en|throned in | Zion;
    proclaim among the | nations · what | he has | done.
12. For he who avenges | blood re|members; ||
    he does not ig|nore the · cries of | the aff|licted.

13. LORD, see how my enemies | perse·cute | me! ||
    Have mercy and lift me up | from the | gates of | death,
14. that I may declare your praises
    in the gates of | Daughter | Zion, ||
    and there re|joice in | your · sal|vation.

15. The nations have fallen into the | pit · they have | dug; ||
    their feet are caught | in the · net | they have | hidden.
16. The LORD is known by his | acts of | justice; ||
    the wicked are ensnared by the | work | of their | hands.
17. The wicked go down to the | realm · of the | dead, ||
    all the | nations · that | forget | God.
18. But God will never for|get the | needy; ||
    the hope of the aff|licted will | never | perish.

19. Arise, LORD, do not let | mortals | triumph; ||
    let the | nations · be | judged · in your | presence.
20. Strike them with | terror, | LORD; ||
    let the nations | know · they | are · only | mortal.
