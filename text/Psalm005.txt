1. Listen to my words, LORD, *
    consider | my la|ment. ||
2. Hear my cry for help,
    My King and my God,
    | for to | you I | pray.

3. In the morning, LORD, you | hear my | voice; ||
    in the morning I lay my requests before you
    | and | wait ex|pectantly.
4. For you are not a God who is pleased with wickedness; *
    with you, evil people | are not | welcome. ||
5. The arrogant | cannot | stand · in your | presence.
    You hate all who do wrong; *
6. you destroy those | who tell | lies. ||
    The bloodthirsty and deceitful
    | you, | LORD, de|test.
7. But I, by your great love,
    can come in|to your | house; ||
    in reverence I bow down
    to|wards your | holy | temple.

8. Lead me, LORD, in your righteousness because | of my | enemies - ||
    make | your way | straight be|fore me.
9. Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; *
    their heart is | filled with | malice. ||
Their throat is an open grave;
    with | their tongues | they tell | lies.
10. Declare them guilty, O God! *
    Let their intrigues | be their | downfall. ||
Banish them for their many sins, *
    for | they have · re|belled a|gainst you.
11. But let all who take refuge in you be glad;
    Let them ever | sing for | joy. ||
Spread your protection over them, *
    That those who love your name | may re|joice in | you.

12. Surely, LORD, you | bless the | righteous; ||
    You surround them with your | favour · as | with a | shield.
