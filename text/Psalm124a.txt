1. If the Lord had not been on our side –
    let Israel say –
2. if the Lord had not been on our side
    when people attacked us,
3. they would have swallowed us alive
    when their anger flared against us;
4. the flood would have engulfed us,
    the torrent would have swept over us,
5. the raging waters
    would have swept us away.
