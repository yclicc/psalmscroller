1. If the Lord had not been on our side –
   let | Israel | say – ||
2. if the Lord had not been on our side
    | when peo|ple at|tacked us,
3. they would have swallowed | us al|ive ||
    when their | anger | flared ag|ainst us;
4. the flood would | have eng|ulfed us, ||
    the torrent would | have swept | over | us,
5. the | raging | waters ||
    would | have swept | us aw|ay.
