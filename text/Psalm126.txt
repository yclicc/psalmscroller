1 When the Lord restored the | fortunes of | Zion, ||
    we | were like | those who | dreamed.
2 Our mouths were | filled with | laughter, ||
    our | tongues with | songs of | joy.
Then it was said a|mong the | nations, ||
    ‘The Lord has | done great | things for | them.’ ||
3 The Lord has done | great things | for us, ||
    and | we are | filled with | joy.

4 Restore our | fortunes, | Lord,
    like | streams | in the | Negev.
5 Those who | sow with | tears ||
    will | reap with | songs of | joy.
6 Those who | go out | weeping, ||
    - | carrying | seed to | sow,
will return with | songs of | joy,
   - | carrying | sheaves with | them.
