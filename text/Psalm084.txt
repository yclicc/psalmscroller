1 How lovely | is your | dwelling-place, || -- | Lord | Al- | mighty!
2 My soul yearns, | even | faints, || for the | courts | of the | Lord;
my heart | and my | flesh || cry out | for the | living | God.
3 Even the sparrow has found a home, * and the swallow a nest for herself, where
she may | have her | young – ||
a place near your altar, Lord Al-| mighty, · my | King · and my | God.
4 Blessed are those who | dwell in · your | house; || they are | ever | praising | you.

5 Blessed are those whose | strength · is in | you, ||
whose | hearts are | set on | pilgrimage.
6 As they pass through the | Valley · of | Baka, ||
they | make it · a | place of | springs;
the | autumn | rains || also | cover | it with | pools.
**2nd Part** 7 They go from | strength to | strength, ||
till each ap|pears be·fore | God in | Zion.

8 Hear my prayer, Lord | God Al-| mighty; ||
listen | to me, | God of | Jacob.
9 Look on our | shield, O | God; ||
look with | favour | on · your an-| ointed one.

10 Better is one day | in your | courts ||
-- | than a | thousand | elsewhere;
I would rather be a doorkeeper in the | house · of my | God ||
than | dwell · in the | tents · of the | wicked.
11 For the Lord God is a sun and shield; *
the Lord bestows | favour · and | honour; ||
no good thing does he withhold
from those whose | way of | life is | blameless.

12 Lord | Al-| mighty, ||
blessed is the | one who | trusts in | you.
