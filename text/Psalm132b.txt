8. “Arise, Lord, and | come · to your | resting place, ||
    you | and the | ark · of your | might.
9. May your priests be clothed | with your | righteousness; ||
    may your faithful | people | sing for | joy.”’

10. For the sake of your | servant | David, ||
    do not reject | your an|ointed | one.

11. The Lord swore an | oath to | David, ||
    a sure oath | he will | not re|voke:
‘One of your | own des|cendants ||
    I | will place | on your | throne.
12. If your sons keep my covenant *
    and the statutes I | teach | them, ||
then their sons shall sit on your | throne for | ever · and | ever.’

13. For the Lord has | chosen | Zion, ||
    he has desired it | for his | dwelling, | saying,
14. ‘This is my resting place for | ever · and | ever; ||
    here I will sit enthroned, | for I | have de|sired it.
15. I will bless her with ab|undant · pro|visions; ||
    her poor I will | satis|fy with | food.
16. I will clothe her | priests · with sa|lvation, ||
    and her faithful people shall | ever | sing for | joy.

17. ‘Here I will make a horn | grow for | David ||
    and set up a lamp for | my an|ointed | one.
18. I will clothe his | enemies · with | shame, ||
    but his head shall be ad|orned · with a | radiant | crown.’
