8. Away from me, all you | who do | evil, ||
    for the | LORD has | heard my | weeping.
9. The LORD has heard my | cry for | mercy; ||
    the | LORD ac|cepts my | prayer.
10 All my enemies will be overwhelmed with | shame and | anguish; ||
    they will turn back and sudden|ly Â· be | put to | shame.
