1. LORD, do not rebuke me | in your | anger ||
    or disci|pline me | in your | wrath.
2. Have mercy on me, LORD, for | I am | faint; ||
    heal me, LORD, for | my bones | are in | agony.
3. My soul is | in deep | anguish. ||
    How | long, LORD, | how | long?

4. Turn, LORD, | and de|liver me; ||
    save me because of | your un|failing | love.
5. Among the dead no one pro|claims your | name.; ||
    Who | praises Â· you | from his | grave?

6. I am worn out from my groaning. *

    All night long I flood my | bed with | weeping ||
    and | drench my | couch with | tears.
7. My eyes grow | weak with | sorrow; ||
    they fail be|cause of | all my | foes.
