1. LORD, how many are my foes! *
    How many | rise · up a|gainst me! ||
2. Many are saying of me,
     | ‘God will | not · de|liver him.’

3. But you, LORD, are a shield around me, *
    my glory, the One who | lifts my · head | high. ||
4. I call out to the LORD,
    and he answers me | from his | holy | mountain.

5. I lie down and sleep; *
    I wake again, because the | LORD su|stains me. ||
6. I will not fear * though tens of thousands
    ass|ail me · on | every | side.

7. Arise, LORD! *
    Deliver | me, my | God! ||
Strike all my enemies on the jaw; *
    | break the | teeth of · the | wicked.

**2nd part** 8. From the LORD | comes · de|liverance.
    May your | blessing · be | on your | people.
