1. LORD my God, I take | refuge · in | you; ||
    save and deliver me from | all who | pursue | me,
2. or they will tear me a|part · like a | lion ||
    and rip me to pieces with | no one | to re|scue me.

3. LORD my God, if I have done this *
    and there is | guilt · on my | hands - ||
4. if I have repaid my ally with evil
    or without | cause have | robbed · my | foe -
5. then let my enemy pursue and | ov·er|take me; ||
    let him trample my life to the ground
    and make me | sleep | in the | dust.

6. Arise, LORD, | in your | anger; ||
    rise up against the rage of my enemies. *
    Awake, | my God; | decree | justice.

7. Let the assembled peoples | gather | round you, ||
    while you sit enth|roned · over | them on | high.
8. Let the LORD | judge the | peoples. ||
    Vindicate me, LORD, according to my righteousness,
    according to my in|tegrity, | O Most | High.
9. Bring to an end the violence of the wicked
    and make the | righteous · se|cure - ||
    you, the righteous God
    who | probes | minds and | hearts.

10. My shield is | God Most | High, ||
     who | saves the | upright · in | heart.
11. God is a | rightous | judge, ||
    a God who disp|lays his | wrath · every | day.
12. If he does not relent,
    he will | sharpen · his | sword; ||
    he will | bend and | string his | bow.
13. He has prepared his | deadly | weapons; ||
    he makes | ready · his | flaming | arrows.

14. Whoever is | pregnant · with | evil ||
    conceives | trouble · and gives | birth to · disi|llusionment.
15. Whoever digs a hole and | scoops it | out ||
    falls into the | pit that | they have | made.
16. The trouble they cause re|coils on | them; ||
    their violence comes | down · on their | own | heads.

17. I will give thanks to the LORD bec|ause · of his | righteousness; ||
    I will sing the praises of the | name · of the | LORD Most | High.
