1. Those who trust in the Lord are | like Mount | Zion, ||
    which cannot be | shaken · but en|dures for | ever.
2 As the mountains sur|round Je|rusalem, ||
    so the Lord surrounds his people *
    both | now · and for | ever|more.

3 The sceptre of the wicked will | not re|main ||
    over the land all|otted | to the | righteous,
for | then the | righteous || might | use ·
    their | hands · to do | evil.

4 Lord, do good to | those · who are | good, ||
    to those who | are · upr|ight in | heart.
5 But those who | turn to | crooked ways ||
    the Lord will banish with the evildoers. *

Peace | be on | Isra|el.
