1. I call on the Lord in | my dist|ress, ||
    - | and he | answers | me.
2. Save me, Lord, from | lying  | lips ||
    and | from de|ceitful | tongues.

3. What will he | do to | you, ||
    and what more be|sides, · you dec|eitful | tongue?
4. He will punish you with a | warrior’s · sharp | arrows, ||
    with burning | coals · of the | broom | bush.

5. Woe to me that I | dwell in | Meshek, ||
    that I | live · among the | tents of | Kedar!
6. Too long | have I | lived ||
    among | those who | hate | peace.
7. I | am for | peace; ||
    but when I | speak, they | are for | war.
