1. I rejoiced with those who | said to | me, ||
    ‘Let us | go · to the | house · of the | Lord.’
2. Our | feet are | standing ||
    in your | gates, Je|rusa|lem.

3. Jerusalem is | built · like a | city ||
    that is | closely · com|pacted · to|gether.
4. That is where the tribes go up – *
    the | tribes · of the | Lord – ||
to praise the name of the Lord *
    according to the | statute | given · to | Israel.
**2nd part** 5. There stand the | thrones for | judgment, ||
    the | thrones · of the | house of | David.

6. Pray for the | peace · of Je|rusalem: ||
    ‘May those who | love you | be se|cure.
7. May there be peace with|in your | walls ||
    and se|curi·ty with|in your | citadels.’
8. For the sake of my | family · and | friends, ||
    I will | say, | ‘Peace be · with|in you.’
9. For the sake of the house of the | Lord our | God, ||
    I | will seek | your pro|sperity.
