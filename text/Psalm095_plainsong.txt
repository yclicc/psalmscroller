1 Come, *let* us sing for **joy** to **the** LORD; *
    let us shout aloud to the Rock of **our** sal*va*tion.
2 Let us come before him **with** thanks**giv**ing *
    and extol him with **mus**ic *and* song.

3 For the LORD **is** the **great** God, *
    the great King **a**bove *all* gods.
4 In his hand are the **depths** of **the** earth, *
    and the mountain **peaks** be*long* to him.
5 The sea is his, **for** he **made** it, *
    and his hands **formed** the *dry* land.

6 Come, let us bow **down** in **wor**ship, *
    let us kneel before the **LORD** our *Ma*ker;
7 for **he** is **our** God *
    and we are the people of his pasture,
    the flock **un**der *his* care.

Today, if only you would hear his voice,
8 'Do not harden your hearts as you **did** at **Meri**bah, *
    as you did that day at Massah **in** the *wil*derness,
9 where your an**ces**tors **tes**ted me; *
    they tried me, though they had **seen** what *I* did.
10 For forty years I was angry with that **gen**er**at**tion; *
    I said, "They are a people whose hearts go astray,
    and they have **not** known *my* ways."
11 So I declared on oath **in** my **an**ger, *
     "They shall never **en**ter *my* rest."'
