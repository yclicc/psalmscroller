1 Come, let us sing for joy | to the | LORD; ||
    let us shout aloud to the | Rock of | our sal|vation.
2 Let us come before him | with thanks|giving ||
    and ex|tol him · with | music · and | song.

3 For the LORD is the | great | God, ||
    the great | King a|bove all | gods.
4 In his hand are the | depths · of the | earth, ||
    and the mountain | peaks be|long to | him.
5 The sea is his, | for he | made it, ||
    and his hands | formed · the | dry | land.
6 Come, let us bow | down in | worship,
    let us kneel be|fore the | LORD our | Maker;
7 for he | is our | God ||
    and we are the people of his pasture,
    the | flock un|der his | care.

Today, if only you would hear his voice, *
8. 'Do not harden your hearts as you | did at | Meribah, ||
    as you did that day at | Massah | in the | wilderness,
9 where your ancestors | tested | me; ||
    they tried me, though they had | seen | what I | did.
10 For forty yours I was angry with that | gener|ation; ||
    I said, "They are a people whose hearts go astray,
    and they | have not | known my | ways."
11 So I declared on | oath · in my | anger, ||
    "They shall | never | enter · my | rest"'
