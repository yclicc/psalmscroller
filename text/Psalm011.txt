1. In the LORD I take refuge. *
    How then can you | say to | me: ||
    'Flee like a | bird | to your | mountain.
2. For look, the wicked bend their bows; *
    they set their arrows a|gainst the | strings ||
    to shoot from the shadows
    | at the | upright · in | heart.
3. When the foundations are | being · de|stroyed, ||
    what | can the | righteous | do?'

4. The LORD is in his holy temple; *
    the LORD is on his | heaven·ly | throne. ||
    He observes everyone on earth; *
    | his eyes | ex·amine | them.
5. The LORD | examines · the | righteous, ||
    but the wicked, those who love violence,
    he | hates | with a | passion.
6. On the wicked he will rain
    fiery coals and | burning | sulphur; ||
    a scorching | wind will | be their | lot.

7. For the LORD is righteous, *
    | he loves | justice; ||
    the up|right will | see his | face.
