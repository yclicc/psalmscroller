1. Answer me when I call to you,
    my | righteous | God. ||
Give me relief from my distress;
    Have mercy on | me and | hear my | prayer.

2. How long will you people turn my glory | into | shame? ||
    How long will you love de|lusions · and | seek false | gods?
3. Know that the LORD has set apart his faithful servant | for him|self; ||
    the LORD | hears · when I | call to | him.

4. Tremble and do not sin;
    when you are on your beds, *
    search your hearts | and be | silent. ||
5. Offer the sacrifices of the | righteous · and | trust · in the | LORD.

6. Many, LORD, are asking, ‘Who will bring us prosperity?’ *
    Let the light of your face | shine on | us. ||
7. Fill my heart with joy
    when their | grain and | new wine · a|bound.

8. In peace I will lie | down and | sleep, ||
    For you alone, LORD, | make me | dwell in | safety.
