6. Praise be | to the | Lord, ||
    who has not let us | be torn | by their | teeth.
7. We have escaped like a bird from the | fowler’s | snare; ||
the snare has been | broken, · and | we · have es|caped.
8. Our help is in the | name · of the | Lord, ||
    the | Maker · of | heaven · and | earth.
