1. Why, LORD, do you | stand far | off? ||
    Why do you hide your|self in | times of | trouble?

2. In his arrogance the wicked man hunts | down the | weak, ||
    who are caught in the | schemes | he de|vises.
3. He boasts about the cravings | of his | heart; ||
    he blesses the | greedy · and | re·viles the | LORD.
4. In his pride the wicked man | does · not | seek him; ||
    in all his thoughts there | is no | room for | God.
5. His ways are always prosperous; *
    your laws are re|jected | by him; ||
    he sneers | at all | his · ene|mies.
6. He says to himself, 'Nothing will | ever | shake me.' ||
    He swears, 'No one will | ever | do me | harm.'

7. His mouth is full of | lies and | threats; ||
    trouble and | evil are | under his | tongue.
8. He lies in wait | near the | villages; ||
    from | ambush · he | murders · the | innocent.
His eyes watch in secret | for his | victims; ||
9.  like a lion in | cover · he | lies in | wait.
He lies in wait to | catch the | helpless; ||
    he catches the helpless and | drags them | off · in his | net.
10. His victims are crushed, * | they coll|apse; ||
    they | fall | under his | strength.
11. He says to himself, 'God will | never | notice; ||
    he covers his | face and | never | sees.'

12. Arise, LORD! * Lift up your | hand, O | God. ||
    Do | not for|get the | helpless.
13. Why does the wicked man | revile | God? ||
    Why does he say to himself, *
    'He won't | call me | to acc|ount'?
14. But you, God, see the trouble of | the aff|licted; ||
    you consider their | grief and | take it · in | hand.
The victims commit them|selves to | you; ||
    you are the | helper · of | the · father|less.
15. Break the arm of the wicked man; *
    call the evildoer to ac|count · for his | wickedness ||
    that would not | otherwise | be found | out.

16. The LORD is King for | ever and | ever; ||
    the nations will | perish | from his | land.
17. You, LORD, hear the desire of | the aff|licted; ||
    you encourage them, and you | listen | to their | cry,
18. defending the fatherless and | the opp|ressed, ||
    so that mere earthly mortals
    will | never a|gain strike | terror.
